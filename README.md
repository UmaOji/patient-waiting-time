# Patient Waiting Time Project
## About
The **Patient Waiting Time** project aims to analyze patient waiting times at a healthcare facility. The dataset includes critical information such as **Doctor Type**, **Patient Type**, **Entry Time**, and **Completion Time**. This analysis will help identify factors affecting waiting times, determine staffing needs, and suggest potential improvements to enhance patient experience.

## Introduction

### Brief Overview of The Project
The Patient Waiting Time project focuses on analyzing the duration patients wait to see a doctor, identifying trends, and understanding the factors that contribute to varying waiting times.

#### Purpose of The Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze patient waiting times to uncover patterns and identify the underlying factors that contribute to delays. By understanding these dynamics, healthcare facilities can implement strategies to enhance patient experience, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall operational efficiency.
